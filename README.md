# Weather-API-Airflow-Project

This project sets up a data pipeline to fetch weather data from a weather API and store it for further analysis. Apache Airflow is used to automate the process of extracting data, transforming it, and loading it into a database or data storage solution.

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to automate the extraction of weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or Weatherstack), perform necessary transformations, and load the data into a database or other storage for future analysis.

Using Apache Airflow, the following tasks are scheduled and managed:

Extract: Fetch weather data for a list of cities or locations.
Transform: Clean and process the raw weather data (e.g., converting temperature units, extracting specific parameters).
Load: Store the processed data into a database, data warehouse, or file system for analysis
